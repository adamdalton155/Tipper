<i><h2>What is Tipper</h2></i>
The title of our project is Tipper, a mobile application written in React-Native JavaScript. With this project, we wanted to meet the goal of successfully 
transferring a sum of money from one user to another. Tipper was developed with waiters and waitresses in mind,
with them being able to receive a payment directly into their own bank account as opposed to the tip being given to the business itself or split between the staff.
